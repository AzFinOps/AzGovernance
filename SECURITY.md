## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in the AzFinOps module, please follow these steps to report it responsibly:

1. **Alert the Maintainers:**  
    Contact the module maintainers immediately by [opening an issue](https://github.com/AzFinOps/AzFinOps/issues) with "Security Vulnerability" in the title.

2. **Provide Details:**  
    Describe the vulnerability with as much detail as possible, including steps to reproduce the issue and potential impact.

3. **Confidentiality:**  
    If the vulnerability is sensitive, please reach out privately to the maintainers via [vulnerability report](https://github.com/AzFinOps/AzFinOps/security/advisories/new) instead of creating a public issue.

## Responsible Disclosure

We value responsible disclosure and aim to address security vulnerabilities promptly. We will acknowledge your report, assess the impact, and work towards a resolution. We kindly request that you avoid publicizing the vulnerability until we've had a chance to address it.
